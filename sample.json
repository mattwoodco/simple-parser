This surge is attributed to a significant post-pandemic rebound in travel, demonstrating strong customer demand. CEO Peter Kern has emphasized a commitment to enhancing travel experiences while adapting to market dynamics and promoting sustainability. The company's proactive approach towards eco-friendly travel initiatives underlines its efforts to engage with modern traveler values, potentially attracting a wider audience. Social media engagement is robust, with campaigns effectively connecting with consumers and driving substantial interaction across platforms, particularly Instagram and Facebook.\n\nEmployee satisfaction rates are also relatively positive, with a Glassdoor rating of 3.8, highlighting the company's solid internal culture and approval rating for leadership. Moreover, Expedia's strategic focus on leveraging advanced technology, such as its diverse tech stack that includes popular frameworks and cloud services, further positions it well for innovation and operational efficiency. However, with a market size of $800 billion and strong competition from players like Booking.com, maintaining competitive differentiation remains crucial for continued success and growth.",
